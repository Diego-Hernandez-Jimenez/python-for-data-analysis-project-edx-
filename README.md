# python-for-data-analysis-project-edx-
final assignment of the course IBM: DA0101EN Analyzing Data with Python (edX)

For this project I was asked to "analyze and predict alcohol consumption by country using attributes or features such as beer servings and wine servings." Some hints were provided, but it was useful overall. It allowed me to put into practice the data analyst methodology: first you need to clean the data, then make some exploratory analysis with descriptive statistics and plots... etc.
